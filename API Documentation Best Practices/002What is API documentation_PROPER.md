## **Types of API Documentation: A Detailed Guide with Examples and Use Cases**
API documentation is essential for developers, testers, and stakeholders to understand how an API works, how to integrate it, and how to troubleshoot issues effectively. API documentation can be categorized into **three major types**:

---
## **1. Reference Documentation**
Reference documentation is like an **encyclopedia** for developers. It provides an in-depth look at the API’s endpoints, methods, request parameters, response formats, authentication mechanisms, and error codes.
### **Use Cases:**
- Developers looking for **exact details** about API requests and responses.    
- Understanding the **data format** expected by the API.    
- Testing API endpoints quickly with example requests.    

### **Example: API Reference - PagerDuty**
- PagerDuty API Docs    
- **Reference Anatomy:**    
    - **Endpoint Structure** 
        Example:
```http
GET https://api.pagerduty.com/incidents
Authorization: Token token=your_api_key
```
- **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "incidents": [
    {
      "id": "PZ12ABC",
      "title": "Server Down",
      "status": "triggered"
    }
  ]
}
```
        
- **Reference: Try it!**  
        Many API docs allow users to **try requests** using a UI (Swagger, Postman, cURL).  
        Example using **cURL**:
        `curl -X GET "https://api.pagerduty.com/incidents" -H "Authorization: Token token=your_api_key"`
        
    - **Interactive API Reference**:  
        Tools like **Swagger, Postman, and Stoplight** allow developers to send test requests directly from the documentation.
        

---

## **2. Conceptual Documentation**
Conceptual documentation explains **why** the API exists, what it does, and what problems it solves. It provides a **high-level understanding** of the API's purpose.
### **Use Cases:**
- Helps **non-technical** stakeholders (Product Managers, Business Analysts) understand the API’s purpose.    
- Helps developers learn **how different parts of an API interact**.    
- Introduces **important concepts** like authentication, rate limits, and API lifecycle.    

### **Examples of Conceptual Topics**
1. **What APIs Do**    
    - APIs allow applications to communicate (e.g., fetching user data from a database).        
    - Example: A banking API allows developers to **fetch transactions, initiate payments, and verify accounts**.        
2. **Key Terminologies Explained**    
    - **Escalation Policies** (e.g., Who gets notified when an alert happens in PagerDuty?)        
    - **Escalation Rules** (e.g., If User A does not respond, alert User B.)        
    - **OAuth Authentication** (e.g., Step 1: Obtain an access token, Step 2: Use the token in requests.)        
    - Example OAuth Flow:        
```bash
curl -X POST "https://auth.server.com/token" \
-d "client_id=your_client_id&client_secret=your_client_secret&grant_type=client_credentials"
```        

        
3. **Getting Started Guide**    
    - **"First API Call" Example**:        
        - Step 1: Register for an API Key.            
        - Step 2: Install SDK or use `curl` to test.            
        - Step 3: Retrieve sample data.            

---
## **3. Task-Based Documentation**
Task-based documentation focuses on **how to achieve specific goals** using the API.
### **Use Cases:**
- Step-by-step guides to help **users accomplish a specific task**.    
- Helps new API users understand **how to implement** API features.    
- Showcases API **best practices and workarounds**.    
### **Examples of Task-Based Docs**
1. **How to Create a User via API**    
    - **Step 1:** Obtain API Key        
    - **Step 2:** Send a `POST` request to create a user:        
```http
POST https://api.example.com/users
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```
        
2. **How to Fetch Data Efficiently**
    - Use pagination to **fetch data in chunks** instead of requesting everything at once:
        `GET https://api.example.com/users?page=2&limit=50`    
    - Response:
```json
{
  "users": [...],
  "next_page": "https://api.example.com/users?page=3"
}
```
        
3. **How to Handle Rate Limits**    
    - APIs enforce rate limits to **prevent excessive requests**.        
    - Example: **429 Too Many Requests**        
    - Solution:
        `sleep 60  # Wait before retrying`

---
## **Optional: Related Tools/Libraries**
To help developers interact with APIs more easily, companies provide additional tools such as:
1. **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**
    - Example: **Google Maps API JavaScript SDK**
```js
new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map"), {
  center: { lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644 },
  zoom: 8,
});
```
        
2. **Client Libraries**
    - Example: **GitHub API Python Client**
```python
from github import Github
g = Github("your_token")
user = g.get_user()
print(user.name)
```        

3. **Command Line Tools (CLI)**    
    - Example: **AWS CLI for API Requests**        
        `aws s3 ls`
---
## **Handling API Errors: What API Users Encounter Most**
Errors are **the most common thing** API users face, so documenting them properly is **crucial**.
### **Common HTTP Status Codes:**

|Status Code|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**2xx**|Success ✅|
|**4xx**|Client-side error ❌|
|**5xx**|Server-side error 🛑|

### **Essential API Error Codes**
1. **400 Bad Request** – The request was **incorrectly formatted**.
    - Example:
        `{   "error": "Missing required field 'email'" }`
        
2. **401 Unauthorized** – Missing or invalid authentication token.
    - Example:
        `{   "error": "Invalid API Key" }`
        
3. **403 Forbidden** – The user **doesn’t have permission**.
    - Example:
        `{   "error": "Access denied" }`
        
4. **429 Too Many Requests** – The client is making **too many API calls**.
    - **Solution:** Implement **exponential backoff**:
        `sleep 10  # Wait 10 seconds before retrying`
        
5. **500 Internal Server Error** – The **API server crashed**.
    - **Solution:** Report the issue and retry later.
### **How Documenting Errors Helps**
- Helps developers **debug faster**.

## **Top 3 Reasons Documentation is a Must-Have**
### **Reason #1: Documentation Helps Reduce Risk**
API documentation plays a **major role in security** by ensuring authentication mechanisms are properly implemented.
#### **1. Preventing API Exploits**
- Poor documentation leads to **security vulnerabilities**.    
- **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) Risks**:    
    - **BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization)** is the **#1 API vulnerability**.        
    - **Broken Authentication** is the **#2 vulnerability**.        
##### **Example: BOLA Attack Due to Poor Documentation**
- A **broken endpoint** allows unauthorized users to access other users’ data.
- Example:
    `GET /users/1234/orders`
    - If API docs don’t clearly define **authorization rules**, attackers may exploit this.
#### **2. Catching Mistakes Early**
- Documentation acts as an **API design review process**.    
- Ensures compliance with **security standards** and **style guides**.

---
### **Reason #2: No Docs = Zombie APIs (Security Risks)**
**Undocumented APIs are a security threat.** If APIs are not documented, they are **not monitored** and can become attack vectors.
#### **1. Shadow/Zombie APIs Are a Major Risk**
- **Shadow APIs**: APIs that exist but are **not officially documented or monitored**.    
- **Zombie APIs**: APIs that were **deprecated** but still accessible.    
- **94% of organizations** reported **API security incidents** in 2023 (Nordic APIs). 

##### **Example of a Shadow API Attack**
- A company has an **old API endpoint** that was never **fully decommissioned**.    
- Attackers find it and exploit it:    
    `GET /internal/admin-data`    
- Since it was **never documented**, security teams **didn’t know** it was still active.

#### **2. API Catalog = Better Security**
- Maintain a **clear API inventory**.    
- Keep **documentation up to date** to prevent **API security gaps**.    

---

### **Reason #3: No Docs = API Sprawl (Inefficiency)**
**API Sprawl** happens when multiple teams develop **similar APIs** because they are unaware of existing ones.
#### **1. Duplicated Efforts**
- Without documentation, teams may **build redundant APIs**, leading to **wasted time and resources**.
#### **2. Lack of Organizational Alignment**
- If APIs are **not documented**, teams **don’t know what exists**.    
- Leads to **misaligned development**.    

#### **3. Lack of Reusability**
- Undocumented APIs are **hard to find and reuse**.    
- Example: Instead of **creating a new API**, teams could have **used an existing one**.

#### **4. Customer-Centric Documentation**
- Use terminology that **customers understand**.    
- Example: Instead of saying `API Key`, **explain**:    
    `Your API key is a secret token that allows your application to authenticate requests.`
