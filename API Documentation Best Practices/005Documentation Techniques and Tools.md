### 🧰 **Documentation Techniques and Tools – Summary**
#### 📌 **Three Main Documentation Approaches:**
### **1. Spec-Based Approach (e.g., OpenAPI)**
    -  Assumes API is designed _before_ it's built
    - ✅ Pros:        
        - Centralized & reusable            
        - Reduces duplicated effort            
        - Allows early feedback before implementation
            
    - ❌ Cons:       
        - Risk of implementation/spec mismatch  
        - code can get out of sync with docs
    - 🛠 Tools: OpenAPI, Swagger, Stoplight
        
### **2. Code Annotations**    
    - **Embedded comments in code to generate docs**        
    - ✅ Pros:      
        - Docs match the code exactly            
        - No extra tooling required            
    - ❌ **Cons:**        
        - Tech writers/Product Managers must touch code            
        - Requires at least stubbed code to start
            
### **3. Hand-Curated (Bespoke) Documentation**    
    - Manual creation via CMS or text tools
    - ✅ Pros:        
        - Easy to start, flexible            
        - Doesn’t require specs or code knowledge  
        - Little tooling required
        - Accomplished with any CMS
    - ❌ Cons:   
        - Hard to maintain consistency/sync        
        - Difficult to kepe in sync with API contract
        - No integration with automation or developer tools            
        - Lacks advanced features like interactive "Try it" components

#### 🧪 **Tool Recommendations**
- ✅ **Strong API Documentation Tools:**    
    - **Stoplight** – spec-driven, open source options        
    - **Redocly** – focused on OpenAPI documentation        
    - **Readme** – polished, dev-friendly        
    - **SwaggerHub** – API lifecycle management + documentation        
- ❗ **Less Suitable for API Docs:**    
    - **Notion or generic CMS** – great for general content, but lacks API tooling        
- ❌ **Avoid from Scratch:**    
    - Hand-building portals or writing specs manually is time-consuming and not recommended due to many existing open-source tools.

### ✅ **Question 1:**
**What is one pro of using a Spec-based method to documentation?**  
🅐 **Either Design-first minimizes duplicated effort or it creates earlier feedback loops** ✅
- This is the correct answer, as spec-based documentation allows early feedback and reduces duplicate work.
---
### ✅ **Question 2:**
**What are some documentation tools you can use?**  
🅑 **Stoplight, Swaggerhub, Readme, Redocly** ✅
- These are all proper API documentation platforms mentioned in the module.
---
### ✅ **Question 3:**
**Which of these is NOT a technique you can apply to your documentation writing?**  
🅓 **An API-first approach** ✅
- "API-first" is a design philosophy, not a documentation technique like code annotations, spec-based, or bespoke approaches.
