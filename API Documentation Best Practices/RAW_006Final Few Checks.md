### Best Practices for Writing Great Docs
* Multi-Media Documentation: The best way to avoid alienating low-code developers is by providing rich documentation with pictures and flowcharts. This type of documentation is useful for less technical users and helps them understand the defined relationship between APls.
	* One of the biggest issues with API documentation is that it often stops at the "send a request, get a result" stage. However, effective documentation should go beyond this and provide a step-by-step guide to help developers navigate the entire API lifecycle. Multi-media documentation can make a huge difference in consumption and what low code developers get out of your APls.

* Interactive Docs, Not Static: With interactive documentation and copy-paste code samples, you'll help developers quickly get to success. Devs won't just read your documentation, they can provide input to it and inspect a response. Right from your API reference, they can declare parameters and make live calls to your API.
	* With interactive documentation, you're removing a major barrier to taking the next step with an API. With static documentation, developers would need to bring API calls to a request utility or directly into code before they can understand what's possible. Instead, they can see what's possible without leaving their browser.

Is your content up-to-date?
* Old content is confusing and causes support woes
* Keep screenshots to a minimum and focused on specific functionality
* Review overview content and tutorials as an integrated part of dev/review lifecycle

* Streamlined content aids findability and usability
* Avoid repeating content, even if you have reuse standards
* Repetitive content confuses users
* Help search results by returning only relevant content

Is your documentation consistent in tone and style?
* Enforce good governance and security measures.
* Create consistency and a solid developer experience.
