## 1. Good docs matter to security
Better docs= more consistency
Writing better documentation leads to greater consistency and standardization.
* Expose inconsistencies: Comparing docs across APIs highlights problems
* Improve quality: Implicit QA by docs writers, explicit functional view for testing
* More secure: less room for error in security and ops (no zombies!)
Bad, poorly maintained, and/or non-existent documentation is an increased risk for security exposures.

Use docs in the security review process
In both a documentation-first and design-first methodology, auth can be security reviewed before any implementation has taken place.

Run you docs through our security review. how? putting security measure in your API style guides is big step in the right direction. as part of API design review + security process style guides can establish auth rulesets that prevent inconsistency.
* One weapon in you repository can be a security style guide. your api teams may already use style guides to automate the enforcement of data formats or endpoint naming convention.
* With a well-chosen set of enforceable security rules, you can use the same tools to dramatically fortify your defenses against data theft and resource exploits.

## 2. Good docs matter for improved governance.
Automate Consistency
1. Manually maintaining documentation is risky
	1. Easy to create inconsistencies
2. Consistency and standardization
	2. Style guides and linting
		1. Manually curated vs automated 
		2. spectral: robust governance rulesets, including docs
		3. vale: docs style linter
3. Scaling with ease/ability to replicate and reuse
4. Style guides make docs more consistent and pleasing to the developer eye

## 3. Good docs matter for partnership
* Brand Affinity
* Increased API Adoption
* Scaling your API, producing ROI
