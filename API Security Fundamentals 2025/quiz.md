### ✅ **Question 1:**
**What percentage of respondents in a Nokia/RapidAPI survey perform security testing on their APIs?**  
🅰️ **4%**
> Most organizations neglect API security testing, making APIs a soft target.

---

### ✅ **Question 2:**
**What is a significant difference between traditional cyberattacks and API attacks?**  
🅰️ **API attacks involve fewer steps to reach a breach than traditional cyberattacks**
> API attacks can directly access sensitive data or business logic.

---

### ✅ **Question 3:**
**What is the top API vulnerability in the OWASP API Security Top 10?**  
🅰️ **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**
> BOLA allows attackers to access data belonging to other users.

---

### ✅ **Question 4:**
**Which principle is emphasized to mitigate BOLA risks?**  
🅰️ **Enforce least privilege**
> Ensure users can only access the resources they're authorized to.

---

### ✅ **Question 5:**
**Which vulnerability involves modifying or escalating privileges improperly?**  
🅰️ **Broken Function Level Authorization**
> It allows users to perform actions they shouldn't be allowed to.

---

### ✅ **Question 6:**
**What is an example of Security Misconfiguration?**  
🅰️ **All of the above**
> Error messages, misused encryption, and input validation gaps are all misconfigurations.

---

### ✅ **Question 7:**
**What risk does Unsafe API Consumption address?**  
🅰️ **Assuming 3rd party APIs are secure**
> Never assume external APIs are secure—validate and sanitize all inputs and responses.

---

### ✅ **Question 8:**
**Why is it important to train developers on API security issues?**  
🅰️ **Developers can create more secure and resilient APIs**
> Security-aware development reduces vulnerabilities early in the lifecycle.

---

### ✅ **Question 9:**
**What is a common tactic attackers use to bypass rate-limiting defenses?**  
🅰️ **Distributing attacks across many IP addresses
> A common **DDoS technique** to evade IP-based rate limits.

---

### ✅ **Question 10:**
**What is the first step in a threat modeling process?**  
🅰️ **Identify the API attack surface and vulnerabilities**
> Understanding your surface area is essential before mitigation.

---

### ✅ **Question 11:**
**What are the three pillars of API security?**  
🅰️ **Governance, Monitoring, Testing**
> Security must be embedded through the API lifecycle.

---

### ✅ **Question 12:**
**Which tool is helpful for enforcing API governance?**  
🅰️ **API Gateway**
> Gateways help enforce policies, logging, throttling, and access controls.

---

### ✅ **Question 13:**
**What is an example of a logic vulnerability in APIs?**  
🅰️ **Cross-account access**
> A classic business logic flaw where users access others’ data.

---

### ✅ **Question 14:**
**What is a best practice for using 3rd party APIs?**  
🅰️ **Always validate the data being returned**
> Never trust data—even from "trusted" third parties.

---

### ✅ **Question 15:**
**What is a strategy for mitigating risks associated with unknown APIs?**  
🅰️ **Leverage the WAF to discover APIs in use**
> Some modern WAFs can log API activity and detect shadow APIs.

---

### ✅ **Question 16:**
**Why is it important to incorporate security “as far left” as possible in the application lifecycle?**  
🅰️ **To prevent vulnerabilities before deployment**
> "Shift left" security reduces risk and cost of fixing bugs later.

---

### ✅ **Question 17:**
**What is the primary focus of attackers when targeting APIs?**  
🅰️ **Logic flaws and authorization gaps**
> APIs expose logic directly, so these are most often exploited.

---

### ✅ **Question 18:**
**How can you prevent Server-Side Request Forgery?**  
🅰️ **Only process URLs that pass validity checks**
> Never follow URLs directly from user input without validation.

---

### ✅ **Question 19:**
**What is one major benefit of maintaining up-to-date API documentation?**  
🅰️ **Enhanced security and usability**
> Accurate docs help developers implement and secure APIs correctly.

---

### ✅ **Question 20:**
**How should you handle user inputs?**  
🅰️ **Reject any inputs that do not meet expectations**
> Validate everything. Accept only what’s explicitly allowed (whitelisting).
