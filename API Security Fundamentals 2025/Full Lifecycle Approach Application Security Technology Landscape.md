## üîê **API Security Landscape ‚Äì Full Lifecycle Approach**

The security of an API is not just about firewalls or encryption‚Äîit starts from design and continues all the way to retirement.

---
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **API Definition Phase**
This is where API planning and design happen.
#### ‚úÖ **Secure Design**
- Apply **threat modeling** (e.g., STRIDE) to anticipate risks.    
- Use **least privilege**, proper **authentication and authorization**.    
- Avoid exposing sensitive objects or operations unintentionally.    
- Design with **rate limits**, **input validation**, **error handling**, and **data minimization**.    

#### ‚úÖ **Governance**
- Define how APIs should be **documented, deployed, and maintained**.    
- Enforce **naming conventions**, **versioning policies**, and **access control standards**.    

#### ‚úÖ **Policies**
- Create policies for:    
    - **Authentication (OAuth2, JWT)**        
    - **Rate limiting and throttling**        
    - **Encryption (HTTPS, TLS)**        
    - **Data exposure rules**        
- Can be applied via **API Gateways** or **DevSecOps pipelines**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Development Phase**
#### ‚úÖ **Code Reviews**
- Peer reviews ensure no **insecure logic**, **leaked credentials**, or **poor error handling**.    
- Focus on **authorization** and **input validation** in code.    

#### ‚úÖ **Static Code Analysis (SAST)**
- Analyze source code for:    
    - **Hardcoded secrets*        
    - **Insecure libraries**        
    - **Unvalidated inputs**        
- Tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Semgrep
    
#### ‚úÖ **Composition Analysis (SCA)**
- Check dependencies (open source libs) for known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs).    
- Tools: Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check    

---
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Testing Phase**
#### ‚úÖ **Legacy DAST (Dynamic Analysis)**
- Scan the running app/API for:    
    - SQL injection        
    - XSS        
    - Broken Auth        
- Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite    

#### ‚úÖ **Pen-Testing**
- Manual tests performed by ethical hackers.    
- Validate:    
    - Authorization flaws (BOLA)        
    - Business logic errors        
    - Sensitive data leaks       

#### ‚úÖ **Bug Bounty**
- Invite **external researchers** to find bugs.    
- Platform examples: HackerOne, Bugcrowd    

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Deployment Phase**
#### ‚úÖ **Web Server**
- Ensure it's **hardened** (disable directory listings, proper TLS certs).    
- Minimize info leakage (headers, verbose error pages).    

#### ‚úÖ **API Gateway**
- Acts as a **security enforcement point**.    
- Handles:    
    - **Authentication*        
    - **Authorization**        
    - **Rate limiting**        
    - **IP whitelisting/blacklisting**        
    - **Logging**        

#### ‚úÖ **WAF / SIEM**
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Blocks known attack patterns (e.g., SQLi, XSS).    
- **SIEM (Security Info & Event Management)**: Correlates logs and alerts for threat detection (e.g., Splunk, QRadar).    

---
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Retirement Phase**
#### ‚úÖ **Governance**
- Ensure deprecated APIs are not used in production.    
- Document and review APIs regularly for relevance.    

#### ‚úÖ **Versioning**
- Use proper version control (e.g., `/v1/`, `/v2/`) to avoid breaking clients.    
- Helps plan smooth transitions.    

#### ‚úÖ **Deprecation**
- Notify consumers about upcoming retirement.    
- Provide timelines, migration paths, and alternatives.    
- Avoid ‚Äúzombie APIs‚Äù (abandoned but still accessible).

## üöÄ Bonus: [[Three Pillars of API Security]] (Supporting Concept)
1. **Governance** ‚Äì Policy enforcement, version control, and process standardization.    
2. **Testing** ‚Äì Continuous, automated, and manual testing to catch flaws.    
3. **Monitoring** ‚Äì Real-time detection, logging, and alerting via gateways and SIEM.

### ‚úÖ **Question 1:**
**Which of the following technologies is NOT commonly associated with application security?**
üîò **Correct Answer:** **Data Encryption technologies**
üß† **Reasoning:**  
While data encryption (e.g., TLS, AES) is critical for data security and confidentiality, it is not **specific to application security**.  
On the other hand, **SAST, DAST**, and **API Gateways** are core tools/technologies **explicitly designed** to secure applications.

---

### ‚úÖ **Question 2:**
**Why are APIs less commonly exploited via vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting?**
üîò **Correct Answer:** **Such vulnerabilities are generally easily detected and fixed**
üß† **Reasoning:**
- **SQLi and XSS** are classic web application vulnerabilities that are well-known and often mitigated by frameworks, libraries, and scanners.    
- APIs are more prone to **logic-based flaws** like **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)** or **Broken Authentication** than traditional injection flaws.    

---

### ‚úÖ **Question 3:**
**When should security considerations begin during the API lifecycle?**
üîò **Correct Answer:** **At the API definition phase**
üß† **Reasoning:**  
Security must be **‚Äúshifted left‚Äù**‚Äîmeaning it should begin **as early as possible** in the lifecycle, during **design and planning (API definition)**. This ensures secure design, proper governance, and avoids costly rework later.

---

### ‚úÖ **Question 4:**
**Which of the following is most effective for finding API-specific vulnerabilities during the testing phase?**
üîò **Correct Answer:** **Automated API-specific security testing**
üß† **Reasoning:**  
Traditional testing tools may **miss business logic flaws or authorization issues** unique to APIs.  
API-specific tools simulate real API requests and test for:
- BOLA    
- Excessive Data Exposure    
- Improper Rate Limiting  
    Examples: **APIsec, StackHawk, Postman tests with security plugins**
---

### ‚úÖ **Question 5:**
**What is the recommended action when a new API version is published?**
üîò **Correct Answer:** **Update the version and retire older versions**
üß† **Reasoning:**  
Keeping outdated APIs alive introduces **technical debt and security risk**.  
Best practice:
- **Retire older APIs gracefully**    
- Notify clients    
- Encourage migration  
    This avoids "Zombie APIs"‚Äîunused but publicly accessible APIs.
    

---

### ‚úÖ **Question 6:**
**What tool is commonly used during runtime to detect and block API attacks?**
üîò **Correct Answer:** **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
üß† **Reasoning:**  
A **WAF** inspects HTTP/S traffic in real time and applies **rulesets** to detect:
- SQLi    
- XSS    
- Injection attacks    
- Rate-based anomalies  
    **API Gateways** can also help, but **WAFs are runtime-focused** tools that block payloads based on known attack signatures or behavior.
