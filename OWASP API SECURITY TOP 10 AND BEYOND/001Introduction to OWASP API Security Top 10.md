### **Understanding the OWASP API Security Top 10 in Detail**

The **OWASP API Security Top 10** is a project from the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**, which highlights the most critical security risks in **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**. APIs are crucial for modern applications but introduce unique security challenges. This list, first released in **2019** and updated in **2023**, helps organizations identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in their APIs.

---
## **üìå Why Was OWASP API Security Top 10 Created?*

1. **Rapid Growth of APIs**    
    - APIs have become the backbone of modern applications, enabling easy communication between different services.        
    - Instead of building everything from scratch, businesses integrate APIs (e.g., for payments, maps, authentication, etc.).        
    - This widespread adoption increases the **attack surface** for malicious actors.        
2. **Security Gaps in API Development**    
    - Traditional **network security tools, web vulnerability scanners, and firewalls** were **not designed** for APIs.        
    - Many APIs expose **sensitive data** without proper security controls.        
    - Attackers **bypass traditional security** and directly target exposed APIs.        
3. **APIs as a Primary Attack Vector**    
    - Hackers no longer need to **hack into networks**‚Äîthey can directly interact with APIs to **extract data, manipulate systems, or disrupt services** rather than following traditional Kill chain.
    - Security controls such as **firewalls and intrusion detection systems** are often **bypassed** in API attacks.        
    - As a result, **API attacks have become one of the biggest security threats**.

---
## **üìå How Is the OWASP API Security Top 10 Compiled?**
The **2023 version** of the list was compiled using:
- **Bug bounty reports** from platforms like HackerOne & Bugcrowd.    
- **Publicly available security incident reports.**    
- **News about API security breaches** (e.g., LinkedIn, Venmo, Peloton leaks).    
- **Internal research** by OWASP members.

üõë **Challenges in compiling data:**
- **Bug bounties** focus on specific security weaknesses on certain types of findings only.
- Lack of full details
- **Not all API security incidents are reported publicly.**    
- **Incomplete technical details** from security news reports.

# **üõ†Ô∏è OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) - Detailed Breakdown**

![[2019-2023owaspapi.png]]
### **üö® API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**
- **What is it?**
    - API does not properly check **user permissions**, allowing unauthorized access to data.
- **Example:**    
    - A hacker changes `user_id=1234` in an API request to `user_id=5678` and retrieves another user‚Äôs data.
- **Mitigation:**    
    - **Enforce object-level access control** for every request.        
    - Implement **strong authentication and authorization checks**.
---
### **üö® API2:2023 - Broken Authentication**
- **What is it?**    
    - Weak API authentication allows attackers to impersonate users.        
- **Example:**    
    - Missing **rate limiting** allows brute force attacks on API login endpoints.        
    - API tokens **never expire**, making them easy to steal and use.        
- **Mitigation:**    
    - Use **OAuth 2.0** and secure **JWT tokens**.        
    - **Rotate API keys periodically**.        
    - Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.        
---
### **üö® API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization**
- **What is it?**    
    - API allows users to **read or modify** object properties they shouldn‚Äôt have access to.        
- **Example:**    
    - A user sends an API request to change their **account type from "basic" to "admin"**, gaining admin privileges.        
- **Mitigation:**    
    - Implement **strict access control** at the property level.        
    - Validate **user input** to prevent modification of restricted fields.
---
### **üö® API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption**
- **What is it?**
    - Attackers overload the API by sending too many requests, causing a **denial of service (DoS)**.        
- **Example:**    
    - API allows unlimited **file uploads**, leading to **server crashes**.        
    - **No rate limiting** allows spamming of API endpoints.        
- **Mitigation:**    
    - Implement **rate limiting and quotas** (e.g., **1000 requests per hour per user**).        
    - Set **file size limits** on uploads.       

---
### **üö® API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization**
- **What is it?**    
    - Unauthorized users can access **privileged API functions**.        
- **Example:**    
    - An attacker calls an admin-only API endpoint (`/api/deleteUser`) and deletes another user's account.        
- **Mitigation:**    
    - Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)**.        
    - Secure **admin and privileged APIs** separately.        
---
### **üö® API6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**
- **What is it?**    
    - APIs expose **critical business processes** without security controls.        
- **Example:**    
    - An attacker **automates thousands of API requests** to **bulk-purchase** limited-edition products before real users can.
        
- **Mitigation:**    
    - Add **CAPTCHAs** and **transaction limits** for sensitive operations.
---
### **üö® API7:2023 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
- **What is it?**    
    - API fetches data from an **untrusted user input URL**, allowing access to **internal services**.    
- **Example:**    
    - API accepts **arbitrary URLs** and forwards requests to **internal company systems**.
- **Mitigation:**    
    - Validate **all user-supplied URLs**.        
    - Use **allowlists** instead of blocklists.

---
### **üö® API8:2023 - Security Misconfiguration**
- **What is it?**    
    - API uses **default settings, debug modes, or exposes sensitive information**.
- **Example:**    
    - API response contains **detailed error messages** with database credentials.
- **Mitigation:**    
    - Disable **verbose error messages** in production.        
    - Regularly **audit API configurations**.
---
### **üö® API9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management**
- **What is it?**
    - Organizations **fail to track API versions, endpoints, and exposed data**.
- **Example:**    
    - A deprecated **API version** remains active and vulnerable.
- **Mitigation:**    
    - Maintain an **up-to-date API inventory**.        
    - Decommission **old and unused APIs**.
---
### **üö® API10:2023 - Unsafe Consumption of APIs**
- **What is it?**    
    - API **trusts data** from external sources without verification.        
- **Example:**    
    - API **relies on a third-party API** without validating responses, leading to **data injection attacks**.        
- **Mitigation:**
    - Validate **all incoming API data**.
    - Use **secure API integration** techniques.
---
## **üõ°Ô∏è How to Secure Your APIs?**
1. **Use Authentication & Authorization:**
    - Implement **OAuth 2.0, JWT, and API keys securely**.        
2. **Apply Rate Limiting:**    
    - Prevent brute-force and **denial-of-service (DoS) attacks**.        
3. **Secure API Endpoints:**    
    - Disable unnecessary **public endpoints**.        
4. **Implement Logging & Monitoring:**    
    - Detect attacks in **real time**.        
5. **Use API Gateways & Firewalls:**    
    - **Filter, authenticate, and monitor** API traffic.

---
## üîÑ **Key Changes from 2019 to 2023**
### **‚ùå Two Risks Were Removed**
1. **Injection (API8:2019)**    
    - Still relevant, but **mitigation techniques** like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) have reduced major attacks.        
2. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (API10:2019)**    
    - Important for security but **not a major direct attack vector** in API breaches.
### **‚úÖ Three Risks Remained Unchanged**
1. **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) ‚Äì API1**
    - Most **common API vulnerability** and responsible for many breaches.
2. **Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) ‚Äì API5**    
    - APIs still **fail to differentiate permissions properly** at function levels.        
3. **Security Misconfiguration ‚Äì API8**    
    - APIs are often **deployed with default or weak security settings**.
### **üîÑ Four Risks Were Renamed**
1. **Broken User Authentication ‚Üí Broken Authentication (API2)**
    - Now **covers authentication failures for APIs beyond just users** (e.g., service-to-service authentication).
2. **Improper Assets Management ‚Üí Improper Inventory Management (API9)**    
    - Broader term covering **all API components**, including endpoints and dependencies.        
3. **Excessive Data Exposure & Mass Assignment ‚Üí Broken Object Property Level Authorization (API3)**
    - **Combines two risks** into one category that deals with unauthorized access to object properties.        
4. **Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting ‚Üí Unrestricted Resource Consumption (API4)**    
    - Expands to cover **all resource consumption issues**, not just rate limiting.
### **üÜï Five New Risks Added**
1. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) ‚Äì API7**    
    - **APIs making requests to internal services can be exploited** (e.g., attackers force APIs to request sensitive internal URLs).        
2. **Unsafe Consumption of APIs ‚Äì API10**    
    - APIs consuming **untrusted third-party APIs** without validation can introduce security risks.   
3. **Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA) ‚Äì API3**    
    - **A more granular version of BOLA**, focusing on unauthorized access to specific object properties.        
4. **Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows ‚Äì API6**    
    - Attackers can **abuse business logic flaws** (e.g., bypassing payment verification in e-commerce APIs).        
5. **Unrestricted Resource Consumption ‚Äì API4**    
    - APIs **lacking limits** on requests, CPU, or memory usage can be exploited for **DoS (Denial of Service) attacks**.
