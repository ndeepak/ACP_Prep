### **Business Logic Flaws in APIs**
#### **Overview:**
Business logic flaws (BLFs) are vulnerabilities within applications that arise due to weaknesses in the **business rules** or **policies** of a given API. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit the normal functioning of an API by manipulating its intended business logic. These flaws are often **application-specific**, meaning that the same flaw might not apply across different applications.
### **Key Concepts**
1. **Business Logic Vulnerabilities**:    
    - These vulnerabilities arise when there’s an **incomplete understanding** of how an API’s features or functionality can be abused by users. In many cases, these flaws stem from **incorrect assumptions** about how users will interact with the API or failure to account for all possible **user behaviors**.        
2. **Impact**:    
    - Exploiting business logic flaws can lead to **unauthorized access**, **bypassing authentication**, or **tampering with data**. The impact of these vulnerabilities can range from minor issues to **complete system compromise**.

### **Attack Vector Description:**
Business logic flaws **exploit the normal functioning** of an API's processes. These flaws are usually discovered when an attacker has deep knowledge of the application's operations. Since each business logic flaw is **unique to an application**, **identifying them is challenging**.
For example:
- A flawed **payment gateway** logic could allow an attacker to change the transaction amount.    
- A **misconfigured API endpoint** could let attackers access sensitive data, even if they aren't authorized.    
### **Security Weakness Description:**
The weakness occurs when the assumptions about how an API will be used or its constraints are **not enforced properly**. This could lead to:
- **Incorrect assumptions** about how a user should interact with the application.    
- **Failure to validate input** or ensure proper authorization.    
- **Incomplete checks** for what a user is allowed to do with the API.    

For instance, if a developer assumes users will never manipulate the **query parameters** of an API, the developer might not validate the inputs properly, leading to potential exploits.

### **Impacts Description:**
Business logic vulnerabilities can have various **technical impacts**:
- **Unauthorized data access** or functionality access.    
- **Bypassing authentication and authorization** processes.    
- **Tampering with or abusing functionality** to gain advantages (e.g., altering transaction details or bypassing business workflows).

### **Example Case:**
A **real-world example** of a business logic flaw can be seen in the **Experian API leak** (2021). A **partner company** of Experian was allowed to access the API for credit checks. However, they exposed this API functionality in their web app, and this API was **not secured properly**. An attacker could intercept requests and **expose sensitive data** such as **credit scores**. This flaw arose from **misplaced trust** between Experian and the partner, assuming the API would not be exposed.

Another example is when **API keys** are stolen or leaked. Attackers can use these compromised credentials to interact with the API as if they were legitimate users, leading to various malicious activities like **data theft** or **abuse of API features**.

### **Business Logic Flaws Testing Challenges:**
- **Unique to the Business**: These vulnerabilities arise from the specific **business logic** of an API and not a general flaw in security practices.    
- **Hard to Detect**: Automated scanners typically **cannot find** business logic flaws because they target vulnerabilities that result from **misconfiguration** or **poor security practices**, which are not always present in business logic.    
- **Testing Method**: To identify these flaws, testers must:    
    - **Understand the business model** and workflows.        
    - **Think adversarially**: What would an attacker do to **exploit the API's features**?        
    - **Manipulate API inputs**, **bypass authorization**, or **tamper with data** to break assumptions made by developers.

### **Example of Business Logic Flaws in API:**
- **Flawed Authentication**: If an API has an authentication flow that uses **MFA** (multi-factor authentication), but the system allows altering an MFA parameter in the API request (e.g., `MFA=false`), attackers could bypass the MFA step by sending an altered request.    
    **Vulnerable API request:**    
```http
POST /api/v1/login HTTP 1.1
Host: example.com
--snip--
UserId=hapihacker&password=securepassword&MFAVerified=true
```  
If an attacker changes `MFAVerified=true` to `MFAVerified=false`, they could bypass the MFA check, leading to unauthorized access.    

---

### **Preventative Measures:**
1. **Threat Modeling**:    
    - **Understand the business processes** and **workflow** your API supports. Identify potential risks in the design phase to prevent business logic flaws from occurring.        
    - Review and **model possible attack scenarios** and consider **edge cases** that attackers might exploit.        
2. **Reduce Trust in Users**:    
    - Business logic flaws often stem from misplaced trust in **users or systems**. Ensure that users are not given too much control over the **business logic** unless properly validated and authorized.        
3. **Comprehensive Testing**:    
    - Ensure that security testing is performed from an **adversarial perspective**. Testing should not only focus on well-known vulnerabilities but should also explore **how business rules can be manipulated**.        
4. **Secure Coding Practices**:    
    - **Validate inputs** rigorously, particularly when parameters are passed to the backend.        
    - **Enforce function-level authorization** and ensure that users cannot bypass business rules (e.g., admins should only be able to perform certain actions).        
5. **Bug Bounty Programs**:    
    - Encourage **third-party testing** through bug bounty programs, where external security researchers can test your API for potential vulnerabilities that may have been missed internally.

### **Summary:**
- **Business Logic Flaws** occur when API functionality can be misused or abused due to weak controls or improper assumptions about how users will interact with the system.    
- They are **unique to each application** and require deep knowledge of the **business model** and workflow.    
- Testing for these flaws requires a **thorough understanding** of the API and an **adversarial mindset** to break assumptions made by developers.    
- Prevention involves careful **threat modeling**, **input validation**, **secure coding practices**, and the use of **third-party testing** like **bug bounty programs**.
